        <h2>Soft-layered chapati recipe</h2>

        <p>Chapati is a form of roti or rotta (bread).
            Chapati are made using a soft dough comprising
            wheat flour, salt and water. It is more finely
            ground than most Western-style whole wheat flours.

            <h3>Preparation</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Add 3 cups of flour in a bowl</li>
                <li>Add salt, sugar, 2 tbsp of oil and 1 1/2 cups of water in
                    a separate jar. Stir until the salt and sugar dissolves.
                </li>
                <li>Add the liquid mixture in step 2 in the flour bowl (step 1)
                    and mix well
                </li>
                <li>Keep kneading for 10 minutes and add flour if needed until
                    the dough becomes non-sticky. Add 2-3 tbsp of oil and continue
                    kneading until the oil mixes well and the dough is soft.
                    Cover the dough and leave it for 40 minutes
                </li>
                <li>After the 40 minutes, divide the dough into 10-15 equal parts
                    making ball like shapes. Arrange them in a flat surface dusted
                    with flour (covver with a damp tablecloth to avoid drying)
                </li>
                <li>Dust flour in the flat place and take one of the balls and start
                    rolling with a rolling pin to a circular shape, brush oil on top
                    and roll it inwards to form a shape-like a rope, then create a
                    coil-like shape and press the ball down with your palm to make
                    it flat. Repeat this process to the rest of the remaining of
                    dough
                </li>
                <li>Next, start rolling each of the coil-like shape doughs with the
                    rolling pin to form a circular shape again
                </li>
                <li>On a hot pan, place the rolled out circular chapati and fry each
                    side with little oil until its golden brown on medium heat. Place
                    your cooked chapati in a flat plat and cover with an aluminum foil
                </li>
                <li>Repeat this step to the rest of the coil-like dough</li>
                <li>Serve with your favorite stew </li>
